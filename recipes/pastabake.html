        three months to enjoy on busier days.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>mozzarella</li>
        <li>pasta</li>
        <li>cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta following pack instructions, reserving a mugful of the pasta water and draining it 2 mins
            before
            the
            stated time.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a deep, non-stick pan over a low-medium heat, then tip in the aubergine.</li>
        <li>Stir well to coat in the oil, frying until softened and deeply golden all over, around 10-15 mins. Remove to
            a
            bowl and
            pour the remaining oil into the pan.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Mix in the cooked pasta along with a generous splash of the cooking
            water.
        </li>
        <li>Season the mixture well to taste and tip into a baking dish. Combine the cheeses with the panko and a large
            pinch of
            black pepper, then scatter this over the pasta.</li>
    </ol>
