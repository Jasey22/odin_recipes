    <p>This creamy tagliatelle recipe makes a comforting midweek meal. Delicious any time of the day.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>garlic cloves</li>
        <li>plain flour</li>
        <li>parmesan</li>
        <li>parsley</li>
        <li>cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by cooking the pasta following pack instructions. Meanwhile, melt the butter in your largest frying
            pan. Once
            foaming, add the garlic and 25 twists of a black pepper mill. Cook for 4-5 mins, until the garlic is light
            golden and
            fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour to form a paste. Stir for 1-2 mins, then slowly whisk in the chicken stock until you have
            a smooth
            sauce. Pour in the double cream and sprinkle in most of the parmesan. Stir until everything is melted and
            combined, then
            season to taste.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pasta straight into the sauce, alongside a good splash of the cooking water. Mix thoroughly,
            adding a
            little more pasta water if necessary, until you have a thick and glossy sauce.</li>
        <li>Divide between four bowls and serve topped with the chopped parsley and remaining parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
